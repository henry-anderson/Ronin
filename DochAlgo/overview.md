<b>r</b>: The players rating<br />
<b>L<sub>c</sub></b>: The combined lifetime DKP of the player across all accounts<br />
<b>a</b>: The combined DKP accumulated over the last 90 days<br />
<b>c</b>: The amount of confluxes (class specific or pureness) already given to the player combined with the amount of confluxes we would be investing in the player if they were to win their next piece of armor.
<p />

The player with the highest rating receives the next piece of Doch Gul in the order of gloves, chest, legs, boots, helm. Standardizing the player's rating with the amount of confluxes currently invested allows for comparison across players with different pieces. This lets all players that fall into a certain class compete with each other instead of separating players based on which pieces they currently have.

The simplicity of the formula comes down to an equal weight between recent activity and past contribution creating a balance between new players and old players. This allows new players to thrive in the clan, while still requiring old players to put in the work.

Whether the amount of purenesses or class specific confluxes is used depends on the limiting factor. Class specific confluxes are used for rangers and rogues while purenesses are used for warriors, mages, and druids. This is due to the fact that we have a surplus of warrior, mage, and druid confluxes. For DPS classes larger pieces are slightly favored as gloves take two class specific confluxes to make while a chest only takes five yet it is 5x stronger than the gloves.

As an example, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c%20=%207"> for a ranger who already has gloves because they would have used 7 total class specific confluxes to create their chest.

If that player was a druid, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c%20=%206">, because pures are used instead as that is the limiting factor for warriors, mages, and druids and it would take 6 purenesses to create the player's chest.

Suppose the player was a rogue and hasn't received any Doch Gul. In this sitation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c%20=%202"> as it would take two class specific confluxes to create their gloves.

## Eligibility
This is where it starts to get difficult. We must prevent inactive players who have acquired a large amount of points in the past from receiving Doch Gul along with players who rarely play on the account they have designated as their main DG account. Minimum amounts for combined lifetime, combined recent activity, main lifetime, and main activity can be used to disqualify these players.

The problem that arises here is that the clan goes through cycles. It is much easier to accumulate points while we are prospering than it is when we are in a down period. DKP inflation is another factor to consider making it likely that these minimum values will need to be changed. Constantly changing the minimums risks fracturing trust in the clan's leadership as it can be seen as manipulating the algorithm's outcome to disqualify certain players. The solution is the use of a dynamic minimum 90 day activity relative to the total 90 day DKP pool of the rest of the clan.

Simply using minimum activity is not enough, another necessary requirement is steady activity. A power player may acquire 2x the minimum in one month then go inactive yet still be eligible from that single month. This can be solved by requiring the player's 45 day activity to be within a certain percentage of their 90 day activity.
